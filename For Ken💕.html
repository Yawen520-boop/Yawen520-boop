	<h1>For My Love, Ken☺️</h1>
	<h3> I will always love you😚</h3>
	<p>Hello my bao bei hehe I don't think that you're expecting this but tadahh surprise!! 🎉 I just learnt this today and it looks very cool so I decided to do one for you hehe muah I'm actually also just doing this because I don't want to do my essay and I want to make you happy! Actually yesterday was not only your birthday but 520 is also something like Chinese valentines day so happy late 520 baby 🥰 520 is supposed to mean wo ai ni so hence they celebrate this day~ Since you were born on such a day filled with love, <b>I want to give you all of my love too❤️❤️</b> Remember that no matter what I will always be by your side and love you till the end of time! You deserve all the love, care and attention in the world so please don't say you don't matter okay baby🥺 You matter so much to me and seeing you this way really breaks my heart so cheer up my dear for your princess Ya Wen is here hehe kiddinggg🤪 </p> 
	<p> But on a more serious note, I'm so sorry for yesterday :( I should've told you I have finished class right after but I forgot because I was too caught on with the fun I had with my best friend :( I will try harder next time to be more sensitive and take notice on the small actions I do so please give me a chanceee I will prove to you that I'm different from others and I'll make u happy~ ~ Hence please continue to voice out your unhappiness in this relationship alright! Don't worry about the potential fight and arguments that come later because that is part and parcel of relationships!<b> We will get through every storm we face together okayy </b> It's not about who's fault it is in that point of time but instead it's about how we are going to fix it and what did we learn from there~ I love you so much and I really do cherish you a lot💕 </p>
	<p>From what happened yesterday, I learnt that how I show you love and affection might be different from how you like to receive it! I see that you care more about the small details like us spending actual quality time together, reassurance and lots of attention hehe But how I give you my love is more through big gifts and surprises like this and the gojo figurine I gave you on your birthday! I'll still continue to sayang you through how I portray it but now ik how u want to be loved, I will do what you like too! <b> I'll try my best to make u happy alright darling hehe😘😘😘</b></p>
	<h3>I'll spend the whole of eternity with you only😌</h3>
